# taskdaddy
TaskDaddy takes a single line of input from you and turns it into an Outlook task without having to open the full interface of Outlook. It's intended to be a quick way to input tasks into Outlook. It is inspired by Bob Menke's Add Task script, written in VBScript. TaskDaddy, however, is written in AutoIt3. It works as both a GUI and a command line tool.

This was initially released in 2010 and is no longer actively developed, but as of July 21, 2021, I decided to remove dependencies on the old _OptParse.au3 and Outlook.au3 modules, and as a result, it can be compiled again, and this version has been pushed to Github. This must be compiled to work properly, due to the way command line processing works in AutoIt3.
